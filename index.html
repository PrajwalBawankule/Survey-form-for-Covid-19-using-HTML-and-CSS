        <h3><strong>COVID 19</strong></h3>
        <p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak came to light when on December 31, 2019, China informed the World Health
          Organization (WHO) of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan City in Hubei province. On
          January 9, 2020, the WHO issued a statement saying Chinese researchers have made “preliminary determination”
          of the virus as a novel coronavirus.Since then, Covid 19 has a very worst impact on the world.
